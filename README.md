# Bird-Counting
Collaborative project on counting birds in images for the purposes of surveillance and monitoring

The code in the `matlab` folder is a standalone example. (Works with MATLAB 2022b but earlier versions may work as well. Requires the Image Processing Toolbox and the Signal Processing Toolbox.) 
  
The code implements the "silhouette" approach illustrated in the diagram below.
